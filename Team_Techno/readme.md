Build a responsive web platform that recommends career paths and learning resources based on user skills, interests and market trends while offering an interactive portfolio builder.

Explaination :- This project consists of a homepage (index.html) and a career recommendation page (career.html). The homepage features a Bootstrap 5-powered UI with smooth animations, including a slide-down navbar, a fade-in hero section, and a visually appealing features section. It includes an authentication modal for Sign In/Sign Up, which dynamically switches between forms. A "Get Started" button redirects users to the career recommendation page. The career recommendation page offers an interactive and animated experience, where users enter their skills and interests to receive AI-powered career suggestions. A JavaScript-based system dynamically matches user inputs to potential careers like Machine Learning Engineer, UI/UX Designer, Digital Marketer, and more, providing relevant learning resources and career links. The design incorporates modern animations, including typing effects, fade-ins, and hover effects, ensuring an engaging and user-friendly experience.
